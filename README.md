An skkserv server framework in Clojure, heavily inspired by Ring architecture

## Usage

```clojure
(ns example.core
  (:require [clj-skkserv.core :as skkserv]
            [clj-skkserv.middleware :refer [wrap-conversion-only]]))

(def handler
  (-> (fn [type content]
        (case content
          "rich" ["Rich Hickey"]
          "alex" ["Alex Miller"]
          nil))
      wrap-conversion-only))

;; start server
(def server (skkserv/start-server handler {:port 1178 :join? false}))

;; stop server
(.close server)
```

Or just run:

```sh
$ clj -m clj-skkserv.main --handler example.core/handler --port 1178
```
